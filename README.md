## About

Minmath is a minimalistic and user-friendly mental math trainer. This is a pet project that was gradually developed over time to fulfill my own wants in a mental math web app. In the past, I would scavenge the internet for the best sites for developing my mental math skills – something clean and easy to use. While there were a few good ones out there, none exactly matched what I had in mind.

This is my earnest attempt at addressing these desires. It is powered by Django on the backend, uses a Supabase PostgreSQL database, and is deployed on Render – no frontend frameworks were used in the making of this site, just vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I have learned many things over the course of Minmath's development process and it has come a long way since my first conception of it in early 2023, when it was originally known as Mathoughtical. Suggestions for improvements are welcome.
